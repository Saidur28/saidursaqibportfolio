            <h2>Learn About Islam</h2>

            <h3>Core Beliefs</h3>
            <p>Islam is based on several core beliefs that guide the faith and actions of its followers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Belief in One God (Allah):</strong> Islam is a monotheistic religion, affirming that there is only one God, Allah, who is the Creator and Sustainer of all that exists.</li>
                <li><strong>Belief in Angels:</strong> Muslims believe in angels as beings created by Allah, who serve various roles, such as delivering revelations to prophets, recording deeds, and guarding individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Belief in the Holy Books:</strong> Muslims believe in divine scriptures revealed by Allah, including the Quran, which is the final and complete guidance for humanity, as well as previous scriptures such as the Torah, Psalms, and Gospel in their original forms.</li>
                <li><strong>Belief in Prophets:</strong> Islam acknowledges a long line of prophets chosen by Allah to guide humanity. Prophets include figures such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, with Muhammad being the final prophet.</li>
                <li><strong>Belief in the Day of Judgment:</strong> Muslims believe in a Day of Judgment when all people will be resurrected and held accountable for their deeds, leading to eternal reward in Paradise or punishment in Hell.</li>
                <li><strong>Belief in Divine Predestination:</strong> Muslims believe in Qadar, or divine predestination, which means that Allah has knowledge of and control over everything that happens. This belief includes understanding that humans have free will within Allah’s divine plan.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Five Pillars of Islam</h3>
            <p>The Five Pillars of Islam are foundational acts of worship and practice that every Muslim is encouraged to follow.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Shahada (Faith):</strong> The Shahada is the declaration of faith, stating, "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." This proclamation affirms a Muslim’s commitment to Islam.</li>
                <li><strong>Salah (Prayer):</strong> Muslims are required to pray five times a day, facing Mecca. These prayers are a direct link between the worshiper and Allah, serving as a means of spiritual growth and connection.</li>
                <li><strong>Sawm (Fasting during Ramadan):</strong> During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs as an act of worship and self-discipline.</li>
                <li><strong>Zakat (Charity):</strong> Zakat is an obligatory form of charity that requires Muslims to give a portion of their wealth to those in need, fostering social responsibility and compassion.</li>
                <li><strong>Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca):</strong> Hajj is a pilgrimage that every Muslim must undertake at least once in their lifetime if physically and financially able. The pilgrimage occurs annually in Mecca and involves a series of rituals that symbolize unity, humility, and devotion.</li>
            </ol>
