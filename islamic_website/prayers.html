            <h2>Prayers in Islam</h2>
            <div class="content-card">
                <p>Salah (prayer) is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is a fundamental act of worship for Muslims. It connects a believer to Allah and provides spiritual peace and discipline.</p>

                <h3>The Five Daily Prayers</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Fajr (Dawn Prayer)</h4>
                        <p>Fajr is performed before sunrise and consists of 2 Rak'ahs (units of prayer). It marks the beginning of the day with remembrance of Allah.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Dhuhr (Noon Prayer)</h4>
                        <p>Dhuhr is prayed after the sun has passed its zenith and consists of 4 Rak'ahs. It is a time to pause during midday and reconnect spiritually.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Asr (Afternoon Prayer)</h4>
                        <p>Asr consists of 4 Rak'ahs and is performed in the afternoon. It emphasizes consistency in worship and remembrance throughout the day.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Maghrib (Evening Prayer)</h4>
                        <p>Maghrib is offered just after sunset and consists of 3 Rak'ahs. It is a time of gratitude as the day comes to an end.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Isha (Night Prayer)</h4>
                        <p>Isha is performed after twilight and consists of 4 Rak'ahs. It concludes the day with reflection and devotion before rest.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Importance of Salah</h3>
                <p>Praying five times a day is not merely a ritual; it is a means of attaining spiritual discipline, focus, and closeness to Allah. Salah strengthens faith, purifies the heart, and serves as a reminder of our purpose in life.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater." - <strong>Surah Al-Ankabut (29:45)</strong>
                </blockquote>
